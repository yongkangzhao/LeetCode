'''
A valid parentheses string is either empty (""), "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.  For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.

A valid parentheses string S is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into S = A+B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string S, consider its primitive decomposition: S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k, where P_i are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return S after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of S.

 

Example 1:

Input: "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
Example 2:

Input: "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
Example 3:

Input: "()()"
Output: ""
Explanation: 
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".

class Solution:
    def removeOuterParentheses(self, S: str) -> str:
        depth_counter = 0
        start = 1
        result = []
        for i in range(len(S)):
            if S[i] == '(':
                depth_counter += 1
            else:
                depth_counter -= 1
                if depth_counter == 0:
                    result += [S[start:i]]
                    start = i+2
        return ''.join(result)

## didn't make result as a string, since string is imuatable, and every iteration would cause a new string to be created, thus it is slower than concantenation in the end from a list.
